    "body": "I don't do gaming so I cant comment on that, but what I use this monitor for, it's just perfect! Not having heard of this brand before, I was somewhat reluctant to buy it but for the price you can't go wrong. Nice bright display, good text reproduction and easy on the eyes. Thankfully the stand IS adjustable (despite what one reviewer said) not height but angle, just hold the top and bottom of the screen and tilt it. Very pleased with this purchase.",

    "body": "As someone who spends long hours in front of a computer screen, I understand the importance of having a high-quality monitor that provides an immersive and comfortable viewing experience. Recently, I decided to upgrade my monitor to the KOORUI 27 Inch Computer Monitor, drawn to its IPS technology, sleek design, and promised eye care features. With hopes of enhancing my visual enjoyment and reducing eye fatigue, I eagerly incorporated this monitor into my workstation. Why I Needed the Product: My previous monitor was outdated, and I desired a larger screen with better contrast and brightness. Additionally, I wanted to protect my eyes from strain and fatigue caused by long hours of staring at a screen. The KOORUI 27 Inch Computer Monitor seemed like a suitable solution, offering improved visuals, reduced eye fatigue, and versatile connectivity options. Pros: Immersive Visuals and Wide Viewing Angle: The IPS technology and ultra-thin bezel design of the KOORUI 27 Inch Computer Monitor deliver brilliant and clear visuals. The wide viewing angle of 178 degrees ensures a pleasant visual experience from any angle, allowing me to appreciate the sharp and delicate images displayed on the screen. Eye Care Features: The monitor incorporates flicker-free technology, a blue light filter, and 99% SRGB (NTSC 72%) color saturation. These features contribute to a more realistic picture, reduced eye fatigue, and increased visual comfort during long hours of use. Versatile Connectivity: With HDMI and VGA ports, the KOORUI 27 Inch Computer Monitor offers versatile connectivity options, allowing me to connect it to various devices such as Xbox, PC, and laptops. The 75Hz refresh rate and Full HD 1920x1080p resolution ensure high-quality images and smooth transitions, facilitating a seamless switch between work and entertainment. VESA Compatibility: The monitor stand is quickly installed and supports a 75x75mm VESA mount, providing convenience and flexibility in positioning and adjusting the monitor. The tilt feature allows me to find the best viewing angle, enhancing my overall comfort and experience. Cons: Inconsistent Contrast and Brightness: Unfortunately, I found the contrast and brightness of the KOORUI 27 Inch Computer Monitor to be lacking. The screen failed to deliver the desired levels of contrast, resulting in a somewhat dull visual experience. Occasional Glitches: One significant drawback I experienced was occasional screen glitches and momentary blackouts when connected to my Mac. While I suspect that the issue may be related to the dongle connecting the laptop and the screen, it remains a frustrating disruption to my workflow. Conclusion: In conclusion, the KOORUI 27 Inch Computer Monitor offers a mixed bag of features and performance. While it delivers on its promise of immersive visuals, wide viewing angles, and eye care features, the inconsistent contrast and occasional glitches dampen the overall experience. Despite these drawbacks, the monitor's versatile connectivity options, VESA compatibility, and reasonable price point make it a viable option for those seeking a budget-friendly upgrade. However, it is important to be aware of the potential issues with contrast, brightness, and occasional glitches, which may impact the overall satisfaction and reliability of the monitor.",

There are no controls to adjust the picture position which could remedy this situation. So in summary if you don't need VGA it's a nice cheap monitor, but unless you get it at a great price I would advise you look elsewhere.",

I used a 27\" WQHD@144htz as my main, but my 7700K Vega 64 is getting a little old, so while I got this just because the size matched, but it's nice to be able to natively downgrade resolution for games my rig struggles with. The menus, stand, speakers and everything else on this is not great, but the 75fps IPS screen is good, quite good, bezels are much thinner and less noticeable than my Nixeus. They don't line up pixel for pixel being different resolution, but the important thing is good, the part I look at.",

    "body": "No dead pixels. Black screen is truly black, white is white. No obvious bleeding spots, though the room is decently lit. The weird thing is the screen does not truly extend all the way to the edge. There is a few mm of black screen between the edge and the pixels. Text is sharp. YT looks pretty good actually. Of note, the stand is sturdy, but not height adjustable. The base is a medium size square, so takes up a bit of desk real estate. I just put a sound bar over it to hide it, so in the end not the biggest deal. Also, it comes with a VGA port, so if you have a really old computer, I guess you could use it. But it doesn't have a USB-C port, which would makes this monitor a lot more modern. The bottoms are small and on the right bottom edge. The button icons are tiny and blend in with the plastic edge, so good luck with adjustments (TBH I rarely adjust monitors once setup initially.).",

    "body": "I picked this monitor up to gift it to a friend in the future as he has very old monitors that are dim and generally terrible. This monitor is a big upgrade for him, but definitely not a big upgrade for anyone who already has a half decent monitor. While it is \"okay\" for everyday use; it is definitely not for gaming and I wouldn't say that it really supports 75Hz. I did several tests on this unit at 75Hz and as noted in the attached pictures; The unit has ghosting at 75Hz and even 60hz isn't stutter/trail free. These are obviously very cheap bottom tier panels that can barely deliver satisfactory motion performance. Which honestly isn't surprising at this price tier but also doesn't really make these \"great budget options\" vs what else is on the market because there is no magical value that is provided here when the monitors can barely display fluid motion at 60hz. This also supposedly supports Freesync (which popped up on my PC when I connected it and turned on Freesync) but this doesn't support LFC so it only really has a support of a drop of FPS to around 45 before it doesn't work properly.... which is a laughably narrow range. This monitor is definitely an IPS style panel though as it actually has good viewing angles with minimal color shift or backlight bleed which are known IPS traits. Not sure who the panel mfg is as I wasn't able to find anything out about it. It is also weird to me that it uses a little external power brick rather than the standard 3 prong heavy plug that is used for most monitors. I guess this can be both good and bad depending on what kind of desk setup someone has because unfortunately this isn't standard and cannot be extended the way that standard cables can. Overall nobody should be buying this for gaming or motion performance, it is \"decent\" for text and daily usage and that is about it. For my friend; it will be more than fine and I'm sure he will be ecstatic when he gets it for his Birthday. For me I am less than impressed, but at least it has a VESA mount and is decently bright even when tested in my very bright kitchen/family room area.",

It's true to the advertised dimensions and is quite thin. It was very easy to set up with my computer and the settings are simple to use with one caveat (this will be in my con section later). The picture is crisp and clear- perfect for average gaming- and the eye fatigue setting does make a difference when spending the day working on it. My main con on this monitor is that the symbols for the buttons are difficult to see in anything other than bright, direct light. They are the same color as the monitor, but with a slightly different sheen. While this is a bit annoying, you do learn which buttons are which quickly while playing with it. This is a pretty minor con, so I didn't feel it was fair to heavily factor it into the rating. Overall, if you want a large monitor with decent resolution, this is a great, budget-friendly option! It was easy to set up and has excellent resolution for the casual gamer.",

Shame it doesn't have displayport as well but good enough. You won't regret this purchase (if it comes back into stock).",

    "body": "This monitor has good colors and contrast for the price. It has an overdrive setting (\"game mode\") to reduce ghosting quite effectively. It doesn't have speakers, but has a headphones jack. Koorui doesn't have a software for it, but TwinkleTray or any other DDC/CI app will work to send VCP commands to it. Apparently it has a 3 year warranty, for what it's worth. It's a good monitor below $190. But I'd rather have the same monitor in a 24'' format. I'm biased against 27'' 1080p monitors. The ppi is 82, which is rather low, ideally it should be over 100. I don't really have a use for the extra \"3\" diagonal inches versus a 24'' monitor. These extra inches just make the IPS glow stand out more. It also adds an extra kilo in weight and takes more space from your desk or storage space. A 24'' 1080p monitor is cheaper and has 92 ppi. Unfortunately, Koorui 24'' IPS doesn't have headphones jack and might not have the overdrive setting. Things I wish this monitor had: a usb 2.0 output for powering peripherals and a way to dim the LED backlight below the minimum settings. I also wish there were more options to change gamma and to create different user profiles for colors, but that's an issue with all manufacturers",

You can see the ghoslty white overlay clearly when working, however it will not show in a screenshot but does when I video to the screen. I strongly suggest avoiding this model and brand.",

    "body": "I've purchased two of the KOORUI 27” monitors, plus the recommended 75 x 75mm VESA bracket, for my amateur music studio. They're currently working out really, really, well. Plus, should I have any problem, I've been provided with a three year warranty from KOORUI... fingers crossed. Nicely priced, fitted with all the usual ins and outs, a free HDMI cable and an integrated cable tidy, what's not to like ? The picture quality is excellent, with no noticeable flicker. The refresh rate of 75Hz works out really well, especially so with CuBase where screen clarity is really critical. Manual controls, menus and selection are all easily used. Side by side, I can see no discernible difference between either of my monitors, which exactly as it should be. I’m one happy, but so far undiscovered, rock star !",

    "body": "The media could not be loaded. I have been using this monitor for less than a month and unfortunately, I already noticed an issue. After a a couple of minutes on idle, the monitor will go to sleep mode. It will automatically turn off the display to conserve energy, which is good however, it will refuse to “wake-up”. It will continue to flicker as shown on my video. And THAT is the problem. Pressing the power button will not help as it refuses to respond. It’s like it’s stuck in between the sleep and awake mode. The workaround I found so far is to remove then reconnect the monitor cables, cold reboot my pc then turn on and off the monitor. Such a hassle especially it often happens while I am in the middle of doing my daily work and just went back from a bathroom break. That said, I’ll revert to my old trusted monitor anytime soon. Too bad as I really like the color science and the over all size of this monitor. It also has a higher fps cap, which is a welcome feature for a casual fpv gamer like myself. But still, this is is a solid 2/5 star monitor.",

Then I bought this KOORUI 27 Inch FHD Computer Monitor and started using it. Its 27-inch display is very good for working for hours. I can feel the difference when compared to other displays. It is developed with Blue light filter and greatly reduced my eye fatigue. It has an adjustable brightness feature which makes us comfortable while working. It can be connected to a PC, TV Box or laptop with the help of HDMI and VGA ports. Its slim body gives an elegant appearance. This monitor is very low in weight and also easy to carry. This Computer Monitor is very good and provides the best experience of working on the system. Overall, I am very happy with this Computer Monitor.",

The screen is amazingly clear and is absolutely perfect for gaming. My son has a PS5 and this monitor is perfect for gaming. The image quality is excellent and the colours truly look amazing. The monitor has a thin bezel so the screen looks fantastic. Watching Netflix and Amazon Video through the PS5 on this monitor is great too and we have a set of USB speakers connected to the AUX port on the monitor for the sound which works perfectly. Overall I am absolutely delighted with this monitor and for the following reasons I have decided to rate it 5 stars: Looks fantastic Beautiful screen Excellent image quality Perfect for gaming and watching films",

    "body": "The monitor came well packaged and the set up was a breeze (basically a plug and play). I mounted the monitor to my existing desk mount, and I realized it sat much lower than my other 27-inch monitor, which had a higher mounting point. The color saturation was on the light side when compared to my existing monitor (different brand), but that could be a setting or brightness issue. There were no visible pixel defects when tested against various blank color backgrounds. The monitor responsiveness was good with no visible lags. While the monitor does have a very thin visible/physical borders, the actual border will double when the monitor is turned on. I did not like the fact that this monitor only had 1 HDMI port and a dated VGA input port. Overall, I think this monitor offers a great value out of the box, but time will tell how durable the product will be.",

    "body": "Quality monitor with a generous 27 inches on a 16x9 widescreen ratio at a full HD 1080 res. At this point that's all standard stuff but it delivers all the necessities at a good price. It also has mount support and can tilt up and down if needed (which puts it over my previous monitor which I got for the same MSRP), and can be hooked through either HDMI or VGA. I've noticed another review mention it didn't have an aux port (headphone jack-type audio output), but I can confirm it indeed does feature one, it's next to the power cord plugin. The only minor complaint I might have is that the power cord was shorter than my previous monitor and it required me to do some desktop rearranging to accommodate it, but honestly it wasn't enough of an issue for me to ding it for that alone.",

    "body": "Bought two of these because they looked like a good bargain. I have one horizontal for my work PC and another vertical for my Mac. If you haven't noticed, these are basically all coming off the same assembly line. At a certain price point they have to be - they all look so suspiciously similar and have the same garbage features. Any way, the monitors, when they actually work, are fine. The problem is that when they go to sleep there is no way to wake them. This is true on Mac Book Pro (19' Intel) or PC. Adjusting the settings for auto-off does nothing. You have to physically turn the monitors off and then back on. And, for added enjoyment, for Mac users, if the Mac tries to wake the monitor, it will cause your MBP to start to overheat. My fans went into hyper mode and flew to 95C trying to cool down. So it's physical off and then on to make them work. Garbage is going back.",

Setup was easy. (No tools required) 7. 75 Hz refresh rate available What Was Disappointing: 1. No speakers. Even though this monitor takes in audio through the HDMI cable, you must have external speakers attached to it to hear the sound. Not a big deal really. To Be Considered: 1. No Display Port connection 2. Maximum resolution is 1920x1080, That means no 4k or 2k. Overall, I like this monitor. I don't use Display Port anyway. If you do, then an adapter can be used. Otherwise, there is 1x HDMI port and 1x VGA port available. As far as the resolution, it looks great. A higher resolution would make everything look smaller which I don't want since then I would have to scale everything larger which would somewhat defeat the purpose of a higher resolution. There are numerous configuration options using the controls on the monitor. Customization was easy, for example, I didn't like the brightness (too bright for me) nor the color variance. Exploring the monitor's settings and changing the display to what's comfortable to me only took a few minutes total time as I also looked through every other option just to see what was available.",

I think expectations should be reasonable though at this price point and it has its share of failures. For example, the controls are confusing and the build quality of the frame is flimsy. Also, 75 Hz it is hardly for competitive gaming, though perfectly fine for those that play casually. It is void of any stand out features aside from the panel quality, which is arguably decent and completely acceptable for most office work.",

I didn't test this out with gaming as I mainly used this for work, web browsing, and a little movie-watching. If you sit in front of a computer all day, your eyes will thank you due to the blue light filter! I truly did appreciate the ultra-thin frame, especially if you mount two of them, as overly-thick ones tend to sit out like a sore thumb in a dual monitor setup. I have two issues with this: the stand it comes with is relatively low, so I would highly recommend a riser or purchasing a VESA stand to promote better posture. The second issue is that I would have liked to see the VGA port swapped out for either a display port or a USB C, as no one uses VGA in this day and age.",

    "body": "This is a very nice full HD business class monitor. I don't game so I can't comment on response time or other gaming features. The colorimetry looked good using the Windows 11 adjustment wizard. The factory settings were pretty close, I just needed to reduce the brightness and minor tweak to the contrast. The factory settings are very bright, this is a monitor that can get bright, shouldn't be a problem in a brightly lit room. There are no speakers, but there is audio extraction from HDMI to a headphone connector on the rear. For me this is a real plus, I usually use one of those small audio amplifiers along with a pair of small HiFi speakers with my computer. The headphone output makes this plug and play without needing a separate wire to the computer. The controls could be better, they are black buttons on the bottom right of the monitor. I thought they were unlabeled, but a closer look reveals almost impossible to read icons on the font bezel (black on black). The power button isn't separated from the others so its pretty easy to turn it off when changing settings. This isn't a big deal for me, once set up I rarely have a reason to use the menus. The user manual could be better, but if you've ever set up a monitor you probably don't need it. At this price I don't see any of these to be huge negatives. Plus: Large screen for the price Decent colorimetry Bright Things to consider: Only 2 inputs, VGA and a single HDMI, no Display Port Controls and manual could be confusing if you've not set up monitors before In the end I have no problem recommending this monitor at this price. There are certainly better monitors out there that are more expensive, but for the majority of users this is going to be a great monitor. At this price 27\" is a luxury!",

I use a professional calibration tool on all my displays, including this Koorui. After completing the setup, I was pleasantly surprised by the image quality for a monitor in this price range. The 1920x1080 at 60 or even 75 Hz is incredibly good. The firmware gives me many options for really fine adjustment like RGB color, brightness, contrast, gamma, power off, aspect ratio, input, modes (movie, fps, rts, eye saver), game, language. Also the ability to set up audio...that's interesting because this monitor doesn't have audio!? At least not an issue in my opinion. Here are some cons: No firmware update possible, height is not adjustable, no display port. At the end we are talking about a low budget 27 inch monitor. I can give for sure 5 stars for the detailed setup opportunity and of course for the image quality but over all its a 4 star monitor and I would highly recommend it to everyone who’s looking for a huge 27 inch experience for a low price.

    "body": "I work on very large spreadsheets daily and wanted a screen that was a bit larger to work with. I had two 24\" monitors side by side but came across this 27\". It was virtually plug and play. Out of the box I attached it using the VESA holes on the back, then plugged in the HDMI and power cables, and I was up and running. Had to adjust the settings slightly to get everytihng to work properly but once finished you dont have to touch again. Picture quality is great, screen size is awesome, and the larger size let's my eyes relax. My only complaint is the icons for the buttons are very difficult to see but luckily you shouldnt have to touch them often or at all. Overall I couldn't be happier - will be getting a second one soon.",

    "body": "Pros: - High quality images - Dot pitch is barely noticeable (quite impressive given the low pixel density) - Monitor stand doesn't use VESA holes, so they remain accessible to mount things like mini PCs, VESA gooseneck lamps, etc - Has 3.5mm audio jack to output audio from HDMI - Very cheap compared to MOST monitors with similar specs - Actually has a professional website and can be contacted for support (in contrast to other generic no-name/small-fry/start-up companies) Cons: - For most people/use cases, the pixel density unacceptable; monitors this size usually merit 4k resolution (~4x the pixels that 1080p offers) - Lacks built-in speakers (though 3.5mm jack is provided per above; not a big deal for most people) - Uses proprietary power adapter instead of standard power cable - Other, established mainstream brands offer better monitors (same size and resolution, better specifications or additional features) for about the same price (sometimes less if on sale) - It is excruciatingly difficult to attach and detach the monitor mount Verdict: Truly a good monitor, but I would only recommend if and only if better monitors aren't available at comparable or lower prices (it wasn't hard for me to find a handful that were)",

    "body": "First and foremost, the monitor has a 60Hz display, NOT a 75hz. Also, when monitor goes into sleep mode, it gets stuck in an audiable connect/disconnect loop that could be heard through your computer speakers. The sound it produces is the same sound made when you connect and disconnect a usb thumb drive from your PC. I tried two different monitors, thinking maybe I got a defective one the first time around, but nope. They both worked the same and they both where returned. To further verify it was the monitor itself I tried hooking up the second monitor, before I returned it to another computer, and still had the same issues. The screen on the monitor itself is beautiful. Beautiful colors with crisp pictures, and great viewing angles. Although, if your buying this monitor for the 75Hz panel, you will be disappointed. Furthermore, if you have computer speakers hooked up to your PC. The audiable connect/disconnect loop the monitor gets stuck in when in sleep mode gets a bit annoying. At the end of the day, I'd look elsewhere.",

    "body": "Koouri monitor has very good resolution. Downrated from five stars because: Monitor control switches are on underside on black background and are black as is the raised lettering so are very difficult to see without physically turning the monitor either upside down or sideways to view. No instruction sheet included about the control switches which would simplify matters. The only instruction included has to do with mounting the monitor stand and that is so literally sketchy that it is simpler to examine the monitor and stand by eye and determine how to mount it on one's own. Monitor runs via 12v transformer/converter (included) which was not noted in the product description and naturally occupies a large amount of 120v socket plug-in space. Also wanted to use the monitor as a TV display with a Roku box - apart from the above downratings and a couple of minor setup complications, once those all are taken care of it works well.",

    "body": "Ive had this monitor a few months now and i have almost no complaint, it works as a monitor would (because its exactly that) but for this low of a price you would expect something much much worse forsure. My one complaint is that this monitor doesnt turn on or turn off automatically. At first i thought it was something i could deal and not care but its beginning to get on my nerve. If there is no input(AKA your computer is closed), this screen will continually be searching for an input and turn off and on until it does or u turn it off. But the trick is you cant turn it off if the screen is on. You have to wait until it stops searching for an input with the screen open for u to hit a small time window to close it or wait 5 more seconds. Other than that this product has worked and is doing good for me even after 3+ months",

Vermisst habe ich Lautsprecher, wußte aber vorher, dass der Monitor keine Lautsprecher besitzt. Für Gaming nutze ich ihn nicht, daher auch keine Bewertung. Negativ aufgefallen ist mir, dass der Monitor als \"Schnäppchen\" angeboten wurde, aber einen Tag nach Lieferung 30 € (20%) billiger war. Ich vermute, dass Amazons Algorithmus den Preis höher ansetzt, wenn jemand nach bestimmten Sachen sucht. Ich habe den Monitor trotzdem behalten. Nachtrag: Jetzt kostet der Monitor nur noch 126 Euro.",

    "body": "Despite it being FHD (1920 x1080p) and therefore the relatively low pixels per inch count for a 27-inch monitor -- when compared to the optimal 24-inch spread -- the IPS panel and firmware are so advanced that crisp, clear and sharp graphics compete totally favourably with my 28-inch 4K Samsung. I should point out in particular that flicker-free and blue light filtering technology makes it very easy on my eyes -- no more eye fatigue. At 75 Hz, moderate gaming is also doable, although gaming is not what I use the monitor for. $169 is an unbelievably good price. Koorrui is a brand definitely worth recommending. It is just an excellent 27-inch. I found out that although Koorui is not a well-known brand in North America, the mother company, HKC, is one of the very top panel designers and manufacturers in the world. A large number of top-tier monitors and laptops use HKC panels.",

    "body": "Bewertung Bildschirm 27N1 (27 Zoll) Als Bildschirm für Officeanwendungen soweit okay. Keinesfalls für Fotobearbeitung oder Videoschnitt geeignet. Die Farbtreue ist für Bildbearbeitung nicht geeignet, wobei das privat vielleicht weniger eine Rolle spielt. Im Auslieferungszustand hat das Gerät wie die meisten billigen Bildschirme einen leichten Grünstich. Da man aber RGB manuell einstellen kann habe ich schnell mal Grün von 50 auf 45 reduziert. Nun ist das Bild akzeptabel. Im Detail muss ich mich noch damit beschäftigen. Vielleicht fällt es auch nur mir auf, da ich mehrere kalibrierte Monitore verwende, wo einer davon das Zehnfache kostet. Aber wie gesagt für den normalen Consumer soweit okay um Texte zu schreiben, im Web zu surfen und Familienfotos anzusehen, wo die Farbtreue nicht so wichtig ist. Übrigens diese Eigenschaft hat jeder Monitor um diesen Preis. Für ein IPS Panel und 27 Zoll kann man für Officeanwendungen jedenfalls zugreifen. Achtung Falle: Wenn man den Bildschirm an das Notbook ansteckt ist plötzlich der Ton weg. Das liegt daran, dass das Notebook den Ton auf den Bildschirm umschaltet. Der Monitor hat aber keine Lautsprecher sondern nur einen Kopfhöreranschluss. Wenn man aber nicht mit Kopfhörer hört oder dort PC Lautsprecher anschliesst, dann muss man in der Systemsteuerung von Windows dieses Audiogerät 27N1 deaktivieren. Dann bleibt der Ton am Notebook auch nach dem Anstecken des Bildschirmes. Preis-Leistung 5 Sterne Beurteilung wenn man auch die teureren Bildschirme mit berücksichtigt die es am Markt gibt, also Beurteilung der Bildqualität ohne Preis, dann mit viel Wohlwollen 3 Sterne. Das ist aber bei allen Bildschirmen um 150 oder 300 Euro gleich. Da es ein chinesisches Produkt ist vermute ich geringere Haltbarkeit. Das ist meine persönliche Erfahrung mit chinesischen Produkten. Ob es bei diesem Bildschirm anders ist wird sich zeigen.",

The only thing about this monitor is the lighting, it wasn't as bright as my msi monitor but the reason for that is my msi monitor had a ips panel which has more color contrast because it is meant for editing not really competitive gaming. I would say if you want a good monitor for cheap go with this one you won't be disappointed. The last thing I like about this monitor is how many hertz you get to choose from I was surprised tbh.",

    "body": "Purchased on Jan 3, 2023 I just needed a second monitor more than a primary gaming one. I was surprised by how well it performed. It was the second monitor for a brand-new PC, so I've been ensuring it was shut off while not actively using it. May 5, 2023 I'm using the computer to work, and the monitor randomly shuts off. The PC acts as if the monitor is still being used. I check the HDMI connection and seat it. Then I notice that the power indicator on the monitor is not illuminated, so I reseat the power cable at the back of the monitor and the surge protector. Nothing. I've changed outlets, let it sit unplugged for a few days, and ensured everything is updated. The only thing I have yet to try is ordering a new power cable; the one it comes with seems a little lighter than most monitors I've owned. I was unable to register the product on the manufacturer's website because the link doesn't work, and now I can't access the product support page for the same reason.",

    "body": "The KOORUI 24.5 Inch FHD Gaming Monitor is an excellent choice for gamers. The Full HD resolution and VA panel deliver vibrant and crisp visuals, making the gaming experience immersive and enjoyable. The 1ms response time ensures smooth and lag-free gameplay, while the FreeSync & G-Sync compatibility enhances the graphics quality. One thing to note is that I encountered an issue when connecting the monitor through the DisplayPort. Whenever the monitor went into sleep mode, it would occasionally restart upon waking up. To avoid this problem, I recommend using the HDMI port instead, as it doesn't exhibit this behavior. Aside from that, the monitor's features are impressive. The 144Hz refresh rate (via HDMI) and 170Hz refresh rate (via DisplayPort) provide smooth motion and reduce blur. The sRGB color gamut coverage of 99% ensures accurate and vibrant colors. The monitor is also VESA mount compatible and allows tilt adjustments for added convenience. Overall, despite the displayport issue, the KOORUI 24.5 Inch FHD Gaming Monitor offers a fantastic gaming experience with its high-quality visuals, fast response time, and advanced features.",

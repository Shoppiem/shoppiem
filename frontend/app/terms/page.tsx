                    and services (collectively, &#8220;Services&#8221;). This Agreement is legally
                    binding between you

                    entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this

                  <h2 id="limitation-of-liability">Limitation of liability</h2>
                  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the
                    Operator, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers or
                    licensors be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental, special,
                    punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages
                    for lost profits, revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business,
                    business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business

                    limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence or
                    otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to the possibility of
                    such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent
                    permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of the Operator and its
                    affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the
                    services will be limited to an amount no greater than one dollar or any amounts
                    actually paid in cash by you to the Operator for the prior one month period
                    prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The
                    limitations and exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate
                    you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose.</p>
